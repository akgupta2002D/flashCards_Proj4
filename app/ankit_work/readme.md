# Add ankit work here

1. I have two components:
   1. Document Uploader where you can add text and generate flashcards.
   2. flashcardViewer.js: This is supposed to be where flashcards are seen!

2. generate_flashcards: I have an api route to create flashcards using text that the user uploads.

3. Utils:
   1. firebase.js  -- To connect to firebase
   2. LlamaRouter.js -- To make api calls to open router using llama3

4. page.js in root of ankit_work renders the Document Uploader.
